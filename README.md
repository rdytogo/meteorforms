# Meteor Forms
## A down-to-earth online forms to PDF solution.

### How does this work?
Do you use Gravity Forms or Wufoo? If you do, you know that there are various ways to automatically export your entries as PDF files. However, the down-side of most solutions is that the PDF file exported looks like a print out of the entry and not like a paper form that most people are use to seeing. Is there a solution that is easy to use?  Yes, enter Meteor Forms.

[Meteor Forms](https://meteorforms.com) is a service by [RdyToGo](https://rdytogo.com), where you upload a blank paper form that your business regularly uses. We will build the online form that your customers will see, and the PDF export.  This way, you can use the same paper forms you have always used and your customers will be able to use thier computer, tablet or phone to provide you data.

### I want the form on my website
Great, we will provide an embed code that will place the form we designed on your website. Just paste it where you would like to see the form.  The form will look natural and like it was always part of your website.

Simple, go to [Meteor Forms](https://meteorforms.com) now and click "Get Started."
