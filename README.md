# Meteor Forms
## A down-to-earth online forms to PDF solution.

### How does this work?
Do you use Gravity Forms or Wufoo? If you do, you know there are various ways to export your entries as PDF files automatically. However, the downside of most solutions is that the exported PDF file looks like a printout of the entry rather than the paper form most people are used to seeing. Is there a solution that is easy to use?  Yes, welcome to Meteor Forms.

[Meteor Forms](https://rdytogo.com/meteor-forms) is a service by [RdyToGo](https://rdytogo.com), where you upload a paper form that your business regularly uses. We will build the online form your customers will see and the PDF export file.  This way, you can use the same paper forms you have always used, and your customers can use their computer, tablet, or phone to provide you with data.

### I want the form on my website
Great, we will provide an embed code to place the form we designed on your website. Just paste it where you would like to see the form.  The form will look natural and like it was always part of your website.
